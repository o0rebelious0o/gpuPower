gpuPower
========

This systemd service will automatically set the opensource xf86-video-ati GPU driver to 'low' and enable the Gnome 3 Radeon Power Profile Manager to be used without the need for root password every time

To install just run ./install in the source_files directory and to remove run ./uninstall

I made this for my own use so feel free to do so yourself. If you make any improvements, please push them back!
